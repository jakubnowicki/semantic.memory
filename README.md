# semantic.memory

A memory game similar to the one that won the shiny contest last year, but created from scratch using shiny.semantic (with some adjustments). Two players try to find as many pairs of R package hexes (coming from [Appsilon](https://appsilon.com/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)) as they can. The app will count their scores and show who won the game. Semantic memory is based on various shiny.semantic components and makes use of features that come with the FomanticUI, like the mechanism responsible for revealing and hiding cards.
