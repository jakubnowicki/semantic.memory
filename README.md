# semantic.memory

A memory game similar to the one that won the shiny contest last year, but created from scratch using shiny.semantic (with some adjustments). Two players try to find as many pairs of R package hexes (coming from [Appsilon](https://appsilon.com/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)) as they can. The app will count their scores and show who won the game. Semantic memory is based on various shiny.semantic components and makes use of features that come with the FomanticUI, like the mechanism responsible for revealing and hiding cards.

## shiny.semantic PoC contest

semantic.memory was created for Appsilon internal shiny.semantic contest.
The idea was to build a Shiny application which uses shiny.semantic package in less than 24 hours. You can read about it [here](https://appsilon.com/shiny-semantic-pocontest-2020/).

The contest is still open. If you like my application, you can vote for it [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeeuzD76vVogyh9yFjcodCu0JiYrZsqFz_JmXJRDS7uqa2HUg/viewform).
